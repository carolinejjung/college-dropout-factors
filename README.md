# Risk Factors for College Drop-Out
University enrollment is one measure of success of secondary education programs – but how do students perform once in college? In this paper, we examine Portuguese higher education data on students’ demographics, prior education, and university outcomes to create a regression model that universities can easily implement to identify students at risk of dropping out, and ultimately provide them with extra support. We compare eight models created by the stepwise procedure for probit and logistic regression with AIC and BIC criterion at two thresholds. In our comparison, we prioritize sensitivity because we want to ensure that all at-risk students are identified. We select a final model with seven significant features to predict if a student is at risk of dropping out: the mother’s previous education, if they’re in debt, their gender, admission grade, if tuition fees are up to date, and if they hold a scholarship.

This project comes from a class final project for Regression Analysis and Statistical Models (STAT 318) at Wellesley College. We use the dataset named “Predict students' dropout and academic success” which was posted to the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository on December 12, 2021 by Martins et al. from their paper, "Early prediction of student’s performance in higher education: a case study.”
